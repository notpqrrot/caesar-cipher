Hey!


This Is a simple "Caesar Cipher" used by Julius Caesar to send messages to his allies in Roman Times.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract the zip file(Right Click ----> extract all)
2. You will see only one file, cipher.zip
3. At the top find the path and delete it
4. Simply Write "CMD" and enter
5. Make Sure you have any Version of Python 3 installed
6. Run the Command "python cipher.py" hit enter, and youre good to go!
7. Alternate options include running the file in an external IDE or text editor directly like Spyder, Visual Studio Code, Pycharmm etc.



To encrypt, simply write any text you like, same for decrypt.


If you have a key, or how much each letter was shifted by, enter that in the terminal.


Currently the brute force is the way to go. If there was any way to implement a way of checking if a sentence is a real sentence( as opposed to a random string of letters ), i will get to working on that right away.


In the meantime, however, enjoy CC Ver 1.0!
