Hey!
This Is a simple "Caesar Cipher" used by Julius Caesar to send messages to his allies in Roman Times.
To encrypt, simply write any text you like!, same for decrypt
If you have a key, or how much each letter was shifted by, enter that in the terminal.
Currently the brute force is the way to go. If there was any way to implement a way of checking if a sentence is a real sentence( as opposed to a random string of letters ), i will get to working on that right away.
In the meantime, however, enjoy CC Ver 1.0!
